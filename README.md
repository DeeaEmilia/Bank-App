# Bank-App
MyBankApp is a JavaScript-based bank app that I created to showcase my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. The app is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly way for users to manage their finances, including checking their account balance, viewing transaction history, and requesting a loan. The app also allows users to delete their account if they wish to do so.
